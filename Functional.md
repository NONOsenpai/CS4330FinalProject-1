# Functional programming - Does it support functional programming? 
## Java 
No, Java does not support functional programming. All functions or code must be inside of a class. 
The term for this is a closure; a record storing function together with an environment. 
## PHP 
Yes, PHP supports functional programming. There are numerous examples in their documentation which show how to do things both in an object oriented or a functional style 
## C# 
Like PHP, C# does support functional programming in the essence that functions can stand alone outside of a class.

## Summary 
From much of my research, I found a lot of mixed opinions on whether some of these languages are functional, procedural, object oriented, etc. What I make of this is that possibly there is no right answer. Some languages, like Java, don't necessarily support functional programming, but there are ways to use a functional style. PHP as well as C# aren't purely functional, the programmer chooses which style to use when they write. According to the programming paradigms wikipedia page it says "Programming paradigms are a way to classify programming languages based on the features of various programming languages." I feel though, that the paradigm is based more off of the combination of the programming language and the programmer using it. For example, if you have a lighter but use it as a [bottle opener (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ly24ycL1lRI), would you consider it a lighter or a bottle opener? I think that depends on what you want to use it for.
